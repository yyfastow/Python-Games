  Python-Games is a group of famous console based games that I put together with python. It has sudoku and wik=ll have 2 player BattleShip.
  
  ### Sudoku
Sudoku saves every time a player adds and deletes an entry. Therefore the game statrts by allowing you to restart game.
Every turn the console prints the original board and the game board. The original is how the game started as and the game is what

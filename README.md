# Python-Games
  Python-Games is a group of console based board games. It includes chess, Sudoku, battle ship and tic-tac-toe. Its all written in python. You start the game py typing in console "python Chess\chess.py" to play chess for example.
  
### Sudoku
Sudoku saves every time a player adds and deletes an entry. Therefore the game starts by allowing you to restart game.
Every turn the console prints the original board and the game board. The original is how the game started as and the game is what
you could change.

The rules of sudoku are simple: each of the nine blocks has to
        contain all the numbers 1-9 within its squares.
        Each number can only appear once in a row, column or box.

You can not delete any numbers that are not in the original sudoku,
        or to the list the game arginialy started with.

Good Luck!

### Battle Ship

Two player Battle ship game. Players move the computer (better laptop around) between turns making sure not to
peek at the others players board. Between turns it prompts the player with "Ready X's turn" to seperate turns
allowing player 1 to finish without seeing players 2 board.
    
##### Game Objective

The object of Battleship is to try and sink all of the other player's before
they sink all of your ships. All of the other player's ships are somewhere on
his/her board.  You try and hit them by calling out the coordinates of one of
the squares on the board.  The other player also tries to hit your ships by
calling out coordinates.  Neither you nor the other player can see the other's
board so you must try to guess where they are.  Each board in the physical game
has two grids:  the lower (horizontal) section for the player's ships and the
upper part (vertical during play) for recording the player's guesses.

##### Starting a New Game

Each player places the 5 ships somewhere on their board.  The ships can only
be placed vertically or horizontally. Diagonal placement is not allowed.
No part of a ship may hang off the edge of the board.  Ships may not overlap
each other.  No ships may be placed on another ship.
Once the guessing begins, the players may not move the ships.

The 5 ships are:  AircraftCarrier (occupies 5 spaces), Battleship (4),
Cruiser (3), Submarine (3), and Destroyer (2).  

##### Playing the Game

Player's take turns guessing by calling out the coordinates. The opponent
responds with "hit" or "miss" as appropriate.  Both players should mark their
board with pegs:  X for hit, + for miss. For example, if you call out F6
and your opponent does not have any ship located at F6, your opponent would
respond with "miss".  You record the miss F6 by placing a + peg on the
lower part of your board at F6.  Your opponent records the miss by placing.

When all of the squares that one your ships occupies have been hit, the ship
will be sunk.   You should announce "hit and sunk".  In the physical game,
a X is placed on the top edge of the vertical board to indicate a sunk ship. 
As soon as all of one player's ships have been sunk, the game ends.

ships display as O, + are missed shots and X re hits
